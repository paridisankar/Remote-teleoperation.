# Remote-teleoperation.

For the Remote-teleoperation to control the simulated robot “remotely”

to control the robot
with a “remote” pc that does not have ROS

or this we will use the MQTT protocol 

For that i have used mqtt_ros_bridge it is the main bridge controll for the ros to other computer

for get the mqtt_ros_pkg 

cd catkin_ws

cd src

git clone https://github.com/paridisankar/Remote-teleoperation..git

cd src

catkin_make 

This is the step to downlode the mqtt_brige ros pkg
